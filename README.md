# Crossplane HSDP Provider

`provider-hsdp` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/upbound/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
HSDP API.

> [!Important]
> This provider is not endorsed, supported or approved by HSDP. It is a Philips Open Source community managed project. Please do not raise
> SNOW tickets, instead open a issue on the [Github project](https://github.com/philips-software/terraform-provider-hsdp/issues).

## Getting Started

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/philips-software/provider-hsdp):
```
kubectl crossplane install provider xpkg.upbound.io/philips-software/provider-hsdp:v0.35.1 provider-hsdp
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:

```yaml
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-hsdp
spec:
  package: xpkg.upbound.io/philips-software/provider-hsdp:v0.35.1
```

## Credentials

Provider secrets are passed via the `ProviderConfig` resource which in turn 
refers to a Kubernetes secret holding HSDP credentials

```yaml
apiVersion: hsdp.crossplane.io/v1beta1
kind: ProviderConfig
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  credentials:
    source: Secret
    secretRef:
      name: example-creds
      namespace: crossplane-system
      key: credentials
```

### Secret example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-creds
  namespace: crossplane-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  credentials: |
    {
      "service_id": "iam.service.id.here",
      "service_private_key": "----PRIVATE KEY HERE----",
      "region": "us-east",
      "environment": "client-test",
      "debug_log": "/tmp/crossplane.log"
    }
```

|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `service_id`          | Service ID of the IAM Service account to use                        |                         |

## API Reference

You can see the API reference on the [Upbound marketplace](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/philips-software/provider-hsdp)

## Known limitations

* Fields which are marked with `ForceNew` in the Terraform provider do not trigger recreation of 
resources via Crossplane currently. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/upbound/upjet/issues/78) and will be addressed once [CRD Validation rules suport](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2022/09/23/crd-validation-rules-beta/) becomes
widely available starting in Kubernetes 1.25+

## Developing the provider
